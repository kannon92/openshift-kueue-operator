                        kueueGangSchedulingPolicy controls how Kueue admits workloads.
                        Gang Scheduling is the act of all or nothing scheduling.
                        Kueue provides this ability.
                        This field is optional.

                            byWorkload controls how admission is done.
                            When admission is set to Sequential, only pods from the currently processing workload will be admitted.
                            Once all pods from the current workload are admitted, and ready, Kueue will process the next workload.
                            Sequential processing may slow down admission when the cluster has sufficient capacity for multiple workloads,
                            but provides a higher guarantee of workloads scheduling all pods together successfully.
                            When set to Parallel, pods from any workload will be admitted at any time.
                            This may lead to a deadlock where workloads are in contention for cluster capacity and
                            pods from another workload having successfully scheduled prevent pods from the current workload scheduling.
