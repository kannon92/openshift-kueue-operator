                              list. If a job does not have some label with the given key from this list, the

                              have labels with some key from the list, the values of these labels must

                              during the workload creation and are not updated even if the labels of the
                              underlying job are changed.

                                  BackoffBaseSeconds defines the base for the exponential backoff for
                                  re-queuing an evicted workload.

                                  Defaults to 60.

                              backoffLimitCount:
                                description: |-
                                  BackoffLimitCount defines the maximum number of re-queuing retries.
                                  Once the number is reached, the workload is deactivated (`.spec.activate`=`false`).
                                  When it is null, the workloads will repeatedly and endless re-queueing.

                                  Every backoff duration is about "b*2^(n-1)+Rand" where:
                                  - "b" represents the base set by "BackoffBaseSeconds" parameter,
                                  - "n" represents the "workloadStatus.requeueState.count",
                                  - "Rand" represents the random jitter.
                                  During this time, the workload is taken as an inadmissible and
                                  other workloads will have a chance to be admitted.
                                  By default, the consecutive requeue delays are around: (60s, 120s, 240s, ...).

                                  Defaults to null.

                                  BackoffMaxSeconds defines the maximum backoff time to re-queue an evicted workload.

                                  Defaults to 3600.

                                  Timestamp defines the timestamp used for re-queuing a Workload
                                  that was evicted due to Pod readiness. The possible values are:

                                  - `Eviction` (default) indicates from Workload `Evicted` condition with `PodsReadyTimeout` reason.
                                  - `Creation` indicates from Workload .metadata.creationTimestamp.

                              Timeout defines the time for an admitted workload to reach the
                              PodsReady=true condition. When the timeout is exceeded, the workload
                              evicted and requeued in the same cluster queue.
                              Defaults to 5min.
